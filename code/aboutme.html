          <h2>STUDY HISTORY & HOBBY</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated highschool in 2023 and I start to interest with
            Technology since I was study in grade 11. I want to know about tech
            and digital I try to research alot. In the future I want to be a
            software devoloper that can participate devolop tech and help
            sharing experiences to people that want to know about tect industry.
            Try hard dream big.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy reading books and listening to music.
            Reading helps me relax and learn new things, while music makes me
            feel happy and calm. Sometimes, I also like to take walks outside to
            enjoy the fresh air. I like building websites and learning how
            things work behind the scenes. I also write a blog where I share
            what I learn about coding. It helps me remember what I've learned
            and connect with others who are interested in the same things. I
            also like go traveling and go camping because I love to do newthing
            I like to stay with natural that can make me reduce stress and
            fresh.
